                <p>Railroad Park is a 19-acre park in Birmingham, Alabama, that opened in the fall of 2010. It was designed by landscape architect Tom Leader and built by Birmingham-based Brasfield &amp; Gorrie. The park lies immediately south of the Norfolk Southern and CSX rail lines through downtown Birmingham. It stretches from 14th Street to 18th Street along First Avenue South. UAB Hospital and Children's Hospital of Alabama are several blocks south of the park. The park is a public facility owned by the City of Birmingham and managed by the non-profit Railroad Park Foundation.</p>
                <p>Long term plans call for Railroad Park to anchor a greenway running through downtown Birmingham stretching from Railroad Park to Sloss Furnaces.</p>
